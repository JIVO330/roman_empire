 Roma was an urban civilization, that means the cities played an important role inside the Empire, not only as control of the territory also as economic and cultural centres.
 The shiny app "The Roman Empire" wants to be a visual tool about the location of the different settlements around the Empire.
 We have used  a modify dataset from the original works from Hanson2016. You can find the original in the website of Oxford. More info in the "section" "About" inside the App.
 The music that it is possible to hear is from the old game Caesar III from Sierra, it was downloaded from the website .... I do not remember at the moment

 There are 3 versions, with different issues.
 version 1 ,2 they are still unconnected with the database
 version 3 the issue is the music is not auto play and we are trying to  run as background.
