 Roma was an urban civilization, that means the cities played an important role inside the Empire, not only as control of the territory also as economic and cultural centres.

 The shiny app "The Roman Empire" wants to be a visual tool to find  the location of the different settlements around the Empire.
 We have used  a modify dataset from the original works from Hanson2016. You can find the original in the website of Oxford. More info in the "section" "About" inside the App.

 The music that it is possible to hear is from the old game Caesar III from Sierra, it was downloaded from the website .... I do not remember at the moment

 The project has 3 shiny R versions, where I am working in different concepts and issues as a kind of workbench, plus a final version with the results.
  The main idea is that you can hear diverse music in each 'page', they should run automatically, as background.
